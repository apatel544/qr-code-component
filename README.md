## My process

  How I started was by taking a look at the design templates given and creating div-containers in the index.html to divide the components. I then proceeded add the img, h1, and p tags for the 3 main parts for the this component. After that, I created a style.css file and started adding styling based on the style guide. Then after some trial and error I was able to create the expected result!

### Built with

- HTML5 Elements
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I will continue developing my skillset primarily focusing on Responsive Design. A couple concepts I want to get better at are Specificity and Positioning but also wanting to develop my grid and layout knowledge.
